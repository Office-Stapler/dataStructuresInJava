# dataStructuresInJava
- Simple implementations of various datastructures in Java.
So far, only LinkedLists and Queues have been in implemented, but there are many
plans to implement more advanced data structures such as BSTs, Hashmaps and even
graphs.
# Plans for future Data Structures:
- <s>Linked Lists</s>
- <s>Queues</s>
- Stacks
- General tree
- Binary Search Trees
- Red Black Trees
- Splay trees
- Hash Tables
- Priority Queue
